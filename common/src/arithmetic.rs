    // Algorithm rationale:
    //
    // Using the stdlib `chunks_mut` will lead to severe load imbalance.
    // From https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/e94bda3/library/core/src/slice/iter.rs#L1607-L1637
    // if the division is not exact, the last chunk will be the remainder.
    //
    // Dividing 40 items on 12 threads will lead to a chunk size of 40/12 = 3,
    // There will be a 13 chunks of size 3 and 1 of size 1 distributed on 12 threads.
    // This leads to 1 thread working on 6 iterations, 1 on 4 iterations and 10 on 3 iterations,
    // a load imbalance of 2x.
    //
    // Instead we can divide work into chunks of size
    // 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3 = 4*4 + 3*8 = 40
    //
    // This would lead to a 6/4 = 1.5x speedup compared to naive chunks_mut
    //

    // "When no chunk_size is specified, the iteration space is divided into chunks
    // that are approximately equal in size, and at most one chunk is distributed to
    // each thread. The size of the chunks is unspecified in this case."
    // This implies chunks are the same size ±1
