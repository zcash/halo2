//! # orchard
//!
//! ## Nomenclature
//!
//! All types in the `orchard` crate, unless otherwise specified, are Orchard-specific
//! types. For example, [`Address`] is documented as being a shielded payment address; we
//! implicitly mean it is an Orchard payment address (as opposed to e.g. a Sapling payment
//! address, which is also shielded).

#![cfg_attr(docsrs, feature(doc_cfg))]
// Temporary until we have more of the crate implemented.
#![allow(dead_code)]
// Catch documentation errors caused by code changes.
