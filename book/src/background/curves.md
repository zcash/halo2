# Elliptic curves

Elliptic curves constructed over finite fields are another important cryptographic tool.

We use elliptic curves because they provide a cryptographic [group](fields.md#Groups),
i.e. a group in which the discrete logarithm problem (discussed below) is hard.

There are several ways to define the curve equation, but for our purposes, let
$\mathbb{F}_p$ be a large (255-bit) field, and then let the set of solutions $(x, y)$ to
$y^2 = x^3 + b$ for some constant $b$ define the $\mathbb{F}_p$-rational points on an
elliptic curve $E(\mathbb{F}_p)$. These $(x, y)$ coordinates are called "affine
coordinates". Each of the $\mathbb{F}_p$-rational points, together with a "point at
infinity" $\mathcal{O}$ that serves as the group identity, can be interpreted as an
element of a group. By convention, elliptic curve groups are written additively.

*"Three points on a line sum to zero, which is the point at infinity."*

The group addition law is simple: to add two points together, find the line that
intersects both points and obtain the third point, and then negate its $y$-coordinate. The
case that a point is being added to itself, called point doubling, requires special
handling: we find the line tangent to the point, and then find the single other point that
intersects this line and then negate. Otherwise, in the event that a point is being
"added" to its negation, the result is the point at infinity.

The ability to add and double points naturally gives us a way to scale them by integers,
called _scalars_. The number of points on the curve is the group order. If this number
is a prime $q$, then the scalars can be considered as elements of a _scalar field_,
$\mathbb{F}_q$.

Elliptic curves, when properly designed, have an important security property. Given two
random elements $G, H \in E(\mathbb{F}_p)$ finding $a$ such that $[a] G = H$, otherwise
known as the discrete log of $H$ with respect to $G$, is considered computationally
infeasible with classical computers. This is called the elliptic curve discrete log
assumption.

If an elliptic curve group $\mathbb{G}$ has prime order $q$ (like the ones used in Halo 2),
then it is a finite cyclic group. Recall from the section on [groups](fields.md#Groups)
that this implies it is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z}$, or equivalently, to the
scalar field $\mathbb{F}_q$. Each possible generator $G$ fixes the isomorphism; then
an element on the scalar side is precisely the discrete log of the corresponding group
element with respect to $G$. In the case of a cryptographically secure elliptic curve,
the isomorphism is hard to compute in the $\mathbb{G} \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_q$ direction
because the elliptic curve discrete log problem is hard.

## Curve arithmetic

### Point doubling

The simplest situation is doubling a point $(x_0, y_0)$. Continuing with our example
$y^2 = x^3 + b$, this is done first by computing the derivative
$$
\lambda = \frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x} = \frac{3x^2}{2y}.
$$

To obtain expressions for $(x_1, y_1) = (x_0, y_0) + (x_0, y_0),$ we consider 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{-y_1 - y_0}{x_1 - x_0} = \lambda &\implies -y_1 = \lambda(x_1 - x_0) + y_0 \\
&\implies \boxed{y_1 = \lambda(x_0 - x_1) - y_0}.
\end{aligned}
$$

To get the expression for $x_1,$ we substitute $y = \lambda(x_0 - x) - y_0$ into the
elliptic curve equation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
y^2 = x^3 + b &\implies (\lambda(x_0 - x) - y_0)^2 = x^3 + b \\
&\implies x^3 - \lambda^2 x^2 + \cdots = 0 \leftarrow\text{(rearranging terms)} \\
&= (x - x_0)(x - x_0)(x - x_1) \leftarrow\text{(known roots $x_0, x_0, x_1$)} \\
&= x^3 - (x_0 + x_0 + x_1)x^2 + \cdots.
\end{aligned}
$$

Comparing coefficients for the $x^2$ term gives us
$\lambda^2 = x_0 + x_0 + x_1 \implies \boxed{x_1 = \lambda^2 - 2x_0}.$


### Projective coordinates
This unfortunately requires an expensive inversion of $2y$. We can avoid this by arranging
our equations to "defer" the computation of the inverse, since we often do not need the
actual affine $(x', y')$ coordinate of the resulting point immediately after an individual
curve operation. Let's introduce a third coordinate $Z$ and scale our curve equation by
$Z^3$ like so:

$$
Z^3 y^2 = Z^3 x^3 + Z^3 b
$$

Our original curve is just this curve at the restriction $Z = 1$. If we allow the affine
point $(x, y)$ to be represented by $X = xZ$, $Y = yZ$ and $Z \neq 0$ then we have the
[homogeneous projective curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates)

$$
Y^2 Z = X^3 + Z^3 b.
$$

Obtaining $(x, y)$ from $(X, Y, Z)$ is as simple as computing $(X/Z, Y/Z)$ when
$Z \neq 0$. (When $Z = 0,$ we are dealing with the point at infinity $O := (0:1:0)$.) In
this form, we now have a convenient way to defer the inversion required by doubling a
point. The general strategy is to express $x', y'$ as rational functions using $x = X/Z$
and $y = Y/Z$, rearrange to make their denominators the same, and then take the resulting
point $(X, Y, Z)$ to have $Z$ be the shared denominator and $X = x'Z, Y = y'Z$.

> Projective coordinates are often, but not always, more efficient than affine
> coordinates. There may be exceptions to this when either we have a different way to
> apply Montgomery's trick, or when we're in the circuit setting where multiplications and
> inversions are about equally as expensive (at least in terms of circuit size).

The following shows an example of doubling a point $(X, Y, Z) = (xZ, yZ, Z)$ without an
inversion. Substituting with $X, Y, Z$ gives us
$$
\lambda = \frac{3x^2}{2y} = \frac{3(X/Z)^2}{2(Y/Z)} = \frac{3 X^2}{2YZ}
$$

and gives us
$$
\begin{aligned}
x' &= \lambda^2 - 2x \\
&= \lambda^2 - \frac{2X}{Z} \\
&= \frac{9 X^4}{4Y^2Z^2} - \frac{2X}{Z} \\
&= \frac{9 X^4 - 8XY^2Z}{4Y^2Z^2} \\
&= \frac{18 X^4 Y Z - 16XY^3Z^2}{8Y^3Z^3} \\
\\
y' &= \lambda (x - x') - y \\
&= \lambda (\frac{X}{Z} - \frac{9 X^4 - 8XY^2Z}{4Y^2Z^2}) - \frac{Y}{Z} \\
&= \frac{3 X^2}{2YZ} (\frac{X}{Z} - \frac{9 X^4 - 8XY^2Z}{4Y^2Z^2}) - \frac{Y}{Z} \\
&= \frac{3 X^3}{2YZ^2} - \frac{27 X^6 - 24X^3Y^2Z}{8Y^3Z^3} - \frac{Y}{Z} \\
&= \frac{12 X^3Y^2Z - 8Y^4Z^2 - 27 X^6 + 24X^3Y^2Z}{8Y^3Z^3}
\end{aligned}
$$

Notice how the denominators of $x'$ and $y'$ are the same. Thus, instead of computing
$(x', y')$ we can compute $(X, Y, Z)$ with $Z = 8Y^3Z^3$ and $X, Y$ set to the
corresponding numerators such that $X/Z = x'$ and $Y/Z = y'$. This completely avoids the
need to perform an inversion when doubling, and something analogous to this can be done
when adding two distinct points.

### Point addition
We now add two points with distinct $x$-coordinates, $P = (x_0, y_0)$ and $Q = (x_1, y_1),$
where $x_0 \neq x_1,$ to obtain $R = P + Q = (x_2, y_2).$ The line $\overline{PQ}$ has slope
$$\lambda = \frac{y_1 - y_0}{x_1 - x_0} \implies y - y_0 = \lambda \cdot (x - x_0).$$

Using the expression for $\overline{PQ}$, we compute $y$-coordinate $-y_2$ of $-R$ as:
$$-y_2 - y_0 = \lambda \cdot (x_2 - x_0) \implies \boxed{y_2 =\lambda (x_0 - x_2) - y_0}.$$

Plugging the expression for $\overline{PQ}$ into the curve equation $y^2 = x^3 + b$ yields
$$
\begin{aligned}
y^2 = x^3 + b &\implies (\lambda \cdot (x - x_0) + y_0)^2 = x^3 + b \\
&\implies x^3 - \lambda^2 x^2 + \cdots = 0 \leftarrow\text{(rearranging terms)} \\
&= (x - x_0)(x - x_1)(x - x_2) \leftarrow\text{(known roots $x_0, x_1, x_2$)} \\
&= x^3 - (x_0 + x_1 + x_2)x^2 + \cdots.
\end{aligned}
$$

Comparing coefficients for the $x^2$ term gives us
$\lambda^2 = x_0 + x_1 + x_2 \implies \boxed{x_2 = \lambda^2 - x_0 - x_1}$.

----------

Important notes:

* There exist efficient formulae[^complete-formulae] for point addition that do not have
  edge cases (so-called "complete" formulae) and that unify the addition and doubling
  cases together. The result of adding a point to its negation using those formulae
  produces $Z = 0$, which represents the point at infinity.
* In addition, there are other models like the Jacobian representation where
  $(x, y) = (xZ^2, yZ^3, Z)$ where the curve is rescaled by $Z^6$ instead of $Z^3$, and
  this representation has even more efficient arithmetic but no unified/complete formulae.
* We can easily compare two curve points $(X_1, Y_1, Z_1)$ and $(X_2, Y_2, Z_2)$ for
  equality in the homogeneous projective coordinate space by "homogenizing" their
  Z-coordinates; the checks become $X_1 Z_2 = X_2 Z_1$ and $Y_1 Z_2 = Y_2 Z_1$.

## Curve endomorphisms

Imagine that $\mathbb{F}_p$ has a primitive cube root of unity, or in other words that
$3 | p - 1$ and so an element $\zeta_p$ generates a $3$-order multiplicative subgroup.
Notice that a point $(x, y)$ on our example elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + b$ has two cousin
points: $(\zeta_p x,y), (\zeta_p^2 x,y)$, because the computation $x^3$ effectively kills the
$\zeta$ component of the $x$-coordinate. Applying the map $(x, y) \mapsto (\zeta_p x, y)$
is an application of an endomorphism over the curve. The exact mechanics involved are
complicated, but when the curve has a prime $q$ number of points (and thus a prime
"order") the effect of the endomorphism is to multiply the point by a scalar in
$\mathbb{F}_q$ which is also a primitive cube root $\zeta_q$ in the scalar field.

## Curve point compression
Given a point on the curve $P = (x,y)$, we know that its negation $-P = (x, -y)$ is also
on the curve. To uniquely specify a point, we need only encode its $x$-coordinate along
with the sign of its $y$-coordinate.

### Serialization
As mentioned in the [Fields](./fields.md) section, we can interpret the least significant
bit of a field element as its "sign", since its additive inverse will always have the
opposite LSB. So we record the LSB of the $y$-coordinate as `sign`.

Pallas and Vesta are defined over the $\mathbb{F}_p$ and $\mathbb{F}_q$ fields, which
elements can be expressed in $255$ bits. This conveniently leaves one unused bit in a
32-byte representation. We pack the $y$-coordinate `sign` bit into the highest bit in
the representation of the $x$-coordinate:

```text
         <----------------------------------- x --------------------------------->
Enc(P) = [_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _] [_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _] ... [_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _] [_ _ _ _ _ _ _ sign]
          ^                <------------------------------------->                 ^
         LSB                              30 bytes                                MSB
```

The "point at infinity" $\mathcal{O}$ that serves as the group identity, does not have an
affine $(x, y)$ representation. However, it turns out that there are no points on either
the Pallas or Vesta curve with $x = 0$ or $y = 0$. We therefore use the "fake" affine
coordinates $(0, 0)$ to encode $\mathcal{O}$, which results in the all-zeroes 32-byte
array.

### Deserialization
When deserializing a compressed curve point, we first read the most significant bit as
`ysign`, the sign of the $y$-coordinate. Then, we set this bit to zero to recover the
original $x$-coordinate.

If $x = 0, y = 0,$ we return the "point at infinity" $\mathcal{O}$. Otherwise, we proceed
to compute $y = \sqrt{x^3 + b}.$ Here, we read the least significant bit of $y$ as `sign`.
If `sign == ysign`, we already have the correct sign and simply return the curve point
$(x, y)$. Otherwise, we negate $y$ and return $(x, -y)$.

## Cycles of curves
Let $E_p$ be an elliptic curve over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_p,$ where $p$ is a prime.
We denote this by $E_p/\mathbb{F}_p.$ and we denote the group of points of $E_p$ over
$\mathbb{F}_p,$ with order $q = \#E(\mathbb{F}_p).$ For this curve, we call $\mathbb{F}_p$
the "base field" and  $\mathbb{F}_q$ the "scalar field".

We instantiate our proof system over the elliptic curve $E_p/\mathbb{F}_p$. This allows us
to prove statements about $\mathbb{F}_q$-arithmetic circuit satisfiability.

> **(aside) If our curve $E_p$ is over $\mathbb{F}_p,$ why is the arithmetic circuit instead in $\mathbb{F}_q$?**
> The proof system is basically working on encodings of the scalars in the circuit (or
> more precisely, commitments to polynomials whose coefficients are scalars). The scalars
> are in $\mathbb{F}_q$ when their encodings/commitments are elliptic curve points in
> $E_p/\mathbb{F}_p$.

However, most of the verifier's arithmetic computations are over the base field
$\mathbb{F}_p,$ and are thus efficiently expressed as an $\mathbb{F}_p$-arithmetic
circuit.

> **(aside) Why are the verifier's computations (mainly) over $\mathbb{F}_p$?**

This motivates us to construct another curve with scalar field $\mathbb{F}_p$, which has
an $\mathbb{F}_p$-arithmetic circuit that can efficiently verify proofs from the first
curve. As a bonus, if this second curve had base field $E_q/\mathbb{F}_q,$ it would
generate proofs that could be efficiently verified in the first curve's
$\mathbb{F}_q$-arithmetic circuit. In other words, we instantiate a second proof system
over $E_q/\mathbb{F}_q,$ forming a 2-cycle with the first:

## Hashing to curves

Sometimes it is useful to be able to produce a random point on an elliptic curve
$E_p/\mathbb{F}_p$ corresponding to some input, in such a way that no-one will know its
discrete logarithm (to any other base).

This is described in detail in the [Internet draft on Hashing to Elliptic Curves][cfrg-hash-to-curve].
Several algorithms can be used depending on efficiency and security requirements. The
framework used in the Internet Draft makes use of several functions:

* ``hash_to_field``: takes a byte sequence input and maps it to a element in the base
  field $\mathbb{F}_p$
* ``map_to_curve``: takes an $\mathbb{F}_p$ element and maps it to $E_p$.
