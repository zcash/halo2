## Minimum Supported Rust Version

Requires Rust **1.56.1** or higher.

Minimum supported Rust version can be changed in the future, but it will be done with a
minor version bump.

## Controlling parallelism

`halo2` currently uses [rayon](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon) for parallel computation.
The `RAYON_NUM_THREADS` environment variable can be used to set the number of threads.
